# ContractManager
 ContractManger is a REST service (developed in Java) which translates the incentives included in an IncentivePlan into a new Contract proposal that will be saved into an ORION Context Broker GE instance.  This component can be eventually re-used and customized to fulfill the general need of having a REST service which is connected to the ORION GE.
